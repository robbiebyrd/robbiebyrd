Inspired by the British game show that started in 1982, this multiplayer online game pits two teams against one another in a match of letters and math(s).

The game consists of three distinct rounds: the &#34;letters&#34; round, where players draw nine random letters and must compose the longest word they can; the &#34;numbers&#34; round, where players draw a random set of numbers and must reach a target number using only basic math operations; and the &#34;conundrum&#34; round, where users must solve a nine-letter anagram.

### Stirling Engine
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f8a2bd3-c3e5-4a00-98b6-365f3433b366" width="350" align="left" />

The Stirling Engine is meant to be a lightweight, efficient way to process incoming media files. A Stirling Job can normalize uploaded media, extract data from the media and analyze it for additional data enhancements, such as subtitles or metadata.

Stirling also can re-encode media using modern, stream-ready standards, and package media and metadata in a standard, open format.

### MOOMP
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b0d88c-3e8b-4dda-829f-0e47692db5d3" width="350" align="left" />

A re-creation of MOO, the famed text-based, massively-multiplayer online text game system developed at XEROX PARC MOOMP (short for 'MOO with MQTT, MongoEngine and Python') provides an asynchronous environment for building text based, open-world games. Users can connect to the game using Telnet (complete with graphics and colors), or with an HTML client, via Websockets. Users can add programmability to objects using a LUA-based scripting engine, and objects can inherit properties and code from parent objects.

MOOMP was inititally created as a test-bed for autonomous, game-playing AI agents. AI agents can interact through a websocket connection interactively as a human player, or fire MQTT events to affect the game programmatically.
